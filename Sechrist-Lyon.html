    		 Sydnee has stood by me as I adjusted during a big change in my life. She has tolerated many stubborn stands on a pointles ground. Absorbed the stress of decisions I would make through impulsive decisions. I have always managed to keep us on our feet. But I will admit, I have taken some unnecessary risks.

    		Haidyn and Wysper are something else. I know many parents look at their kids and think, these kids are one of a kind. And there are also some out there that look at their kids and go, "Damn, I scraped the bottom of that barrel." But don't worry, I do adore my children. Most of the time. Especially when they sleep. Those are great times.

    		But this is my family. And for all they are, and with all I am, I love them.
